#StudyBuddy

StudyBuddy is an educational app designed to help users create, organize, and review study materials in the form of subjects and flashcards.
It allows users to add subjects, manage flashcards within each subject, and view detailed descriptions of flashcards. The app provides a simple
interface to navigate between subjects, flashcards, and flashcard descriptions.

StudyBuddy is built using Java, and uses the Swing framework for the GUI. The data is currently loaded from a csv file, although future versions
of StudyBuddy will use MongoDB instead. The data.csv file in the project includes some default data.

The add subject and add flashcard buttons are currently dummies. To add new flash cards to the app currently, add the data directly into the 
data.csv file.
